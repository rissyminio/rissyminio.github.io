	<p> <b> Junior from Atlanta, Georgia </b> </p>
	<p> I am a junior at <a href="bju.edu"> Bob Jones University </a> majoring 
	Criminal Justice with a principle in Psychology. I work as a manager in the
	Den on the BJU campus. </p>
	<p> In the little spare time that I have between work and school, I will 
	usually be running errands for family and friends and volunteering for random activites at my home church <a href=berean-baptist.org"> Berean Baptist Church </a>. </p>
	<p> My favorite activities usually include running, reading, and watching Netflix. </p>
