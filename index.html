	<b> Marissa Minio </b>
	<p> <b> Junior from Atlanta, Georgia </b> </p>
	<p> I am currently a junior at <a href="bju.edu"> Bob Jones University </a> majoring 
	Criminal Justice with a principle in Psychology. My plans are to get a job as an investigator in white collar crime. My current job now is a manager at the Den on BJU campus. </p>
		<p> I am 21 years old and happily engaged to an army man. I come from a family of 6, being the second oldest. Growing up my parents both worked full time and I was often put inin
			charge of my younger siblings. I bought and paid in full for my first car when I was 19. I am currently working and paying my way through college. </p>
	<p> In the little spare time that I have between work and school, I will 
	usually be running errands for family and friends and volunteering for random activites at my home church <a href=berean-baptist.org"> Berean Baptist Church </a>. </p>
	<p> My favorite activities usually include running, reading, and watching Netflix. I also enjoy making music (guitar and piano). </p>
